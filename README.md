# Data Visualisation Using Dimple.js
I am using Baseball_Players data for this visualisation

## Summary
I plotted the total number of home runs made and average of players of each height group which are categorised by their handedness, i.e, right-handed, left-handed, or both handed. By doing this I can visualise the total performance of each height group, their performace for a particular handed group, and even compare their performance handedness-wise, two or all at a time.

## Design
I am using a scatter plot for this visualisation as I have to group the performance of players for more than two target variables. Earlier I was using bar chart as I was using only "Home Runs" as the target variable. But after being suggested to include "Average" of the players too, I was prompted to use scatter plot.

## Feedback
1. One eperson recommended me to make the graph comparative. Initially I was showing different categories of "handedness", one per view, and their was no way to compare their performance through a single view.
2. In another feedback I was told to include "Average" in the visualisation too. Previously I was using only "Home Runs" as the target variable.
3. Some other person told me that the viewer should have the option to pause the animation. Earlier I was animating the graph from the beginning with no option to pause it.
